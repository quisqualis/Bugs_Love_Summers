# Bugs_Love_Summers
A student Shiny project that seeks to answer whether warming up trends in the world-wide climate make vector borne diseases more prevalent and more widespread.

Vectors is a fancy name for bugs, such as mosquitoes, ticks, or flies that carry diseases such as zika, malaria or lyme disease.

Since most vectors prefer warmer temperatures, it is likely that increasing periods and geography of warmer seasons be are conducive to their range expansion, which in turn will make vector borne diseases (West Nile Virus, Dengue, Zika, etc.) occur in places where they may not have been reported before. 

This exploration will get the raw data from publically available repositories such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID), Division of Vector-Borne Diseases (DVBD), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) , National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and World Health Organization (WHO).

Data Question
•	Are their global trends in the increase in the vector borne disease?
•	Are vector borne diseases becoming more prevalent with global warming?
